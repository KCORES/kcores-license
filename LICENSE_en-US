KCORES License Version 1.0

Under the following conditions, hereby granted, free of charge, to any person 
or legal entity obtaining a copy of this licensed work (including but not 
limited to source code, Gerber files, CAD files, Verilog files, 3D rendered 
images or videos, compiled binary files, and other files and/or related content, 
collectively referred to as "licensed work"), the individual or legal entity 
authorized shall have the right to dispose of the licensed work for any purpose, 
including but not limited to use, copy, modify, derivative use, distribute, 
publish, and sublicense:

1. Individuals or legal entities must include the above copyright notice and this 
license on each redistributed or derivative copy of the licensed work and may 
not modify them.

2. The use of this licensed work represents the participation of the licensed work 
in the KCORES Open Source Hardware Organization, and this should be indicated 
in the documentation of the licensed work.

3. Entity products produced using this licensed work (including but not limited 
to printed circuit boards, electronic components, molds, models, and other 
related products or content produced or created using this licensed work) 
must clearly indicate the copyright notice of the licensed work and the word 
"KCORES" in a conspicuous location on the product.

4. Software products produced using this licensed work must clearly indicate the 
copyright information of the licensed work and the word "KCORES" in an easily 
discernible manner on the software product interface or in the running 
information.

5. Each redistributed or derivative copy of the licensed work using this license 
must have open source code and source files.

"Open" means that the source code and source files can be publicly posted on 
an internet public code hosting platform (such as github.com) and can be freely 
obtained by anyone.

The source code and source files of the work refer to the preferred form for 
making modifications to the work. For executable files, the complete source 
code represents all source code of the modules it contains, as well as any 
relevant interface definition files and scripts used to compile and install 
the executable file. However, as a special exception, the distributed source 
code does not need to include any components of the operating system on which 
the executable program runs that are distributed normally by the operating 
system (such as compilers, kernels, etc.) in source or binary form, unless that 
component itself comes with executable files. For engineering files such as CAD, 
Gerber, or Verilog, they must be stored and provided in a way that can be opened 
or imported by open-source editors.

This licensed work is provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties, 
including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a 
particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the copyright holder 
be liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising out of, in 
connection with, or in any way related to the software or the use or other 
dealings in the software, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.
